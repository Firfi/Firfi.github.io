Item rental / Catering service in UK.

UPDATE: Because of COVID19 there wasn't much catering anymore, so the client took it down.

Well-tested Java+Lombok code, functional style where needed, object-oriented where not.

When I took it the frontend requirements were growing (needed some dynamic, feature-rich pages) but the frontend part was far into dark and sad legacy code.

I’ve lifted the parts needed into React+mobx, allowing the introduction of new features and changing requirements with ease.

On the backend part there wasn’t much excitement, just neat Java (latest version) code with tests.
