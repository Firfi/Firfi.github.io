<em>"We went through plenty of Upwork applicants who were ether "cherry
picking" , brokering, or just didn't have the ability, until Igor
contacted me.

He reviewed our problems and solved them all, as he plowed through a
several tough work sessions. He fixed everything as he suggested even
better solutions along the way!

So far, Igor was one of our best remote workers, doing an outstandingly good job."</em>
